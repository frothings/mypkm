# Nutrients
- **Vitamin A**: The yellow-orange pigments in colourful fruit contain beta-carotene which is converted to vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for the formation and maintenance of healthy skin and hair.
- **Protein**: Protein helps repair and maintain the body. Broken down to amino acids by the gut to be absorbed in the body, they are re-assembled to form the proteins that are needed to build, maintain and protect the body.
- **Calcium**: Strengthens growing bones and teeth
- **Iron**: Eating food rich in iron will help you build haemoglobin, the factor in blood that helps transport oxygen, helping to nourish all the cells of the body. ([x](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/gals_guide_model_eating))
